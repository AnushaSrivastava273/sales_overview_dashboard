# Sales Overview Dashboard

This project showcases a Sales Overview Dashboard built to analyze regional sales performance across the United States. The goal is to provide a clear, visual, and data-driven summary of how different regions and states are contributing to overall business performance over time.

## Purpose

The dashboard is designed to help sales and business teams:
- Track current year vs previous year performance
- Understand regional trends and outliers
- Identify areas of growth or decline
- Support strategic decision-making with data

## Dashboard Sections

### Regional Performance Panels

Each of the four major regions (Central, East, South, and West) has a dedicated panel showing:
- Current Year (CY) Sales
- Previous Year (PY) Sales
- Monthly sales distribution
- Visual comparison between CY and PY

### Interactive Map

A US map displays sales distribution by state, color-coded by region. This helps quickly identify which states are driving performance within each region.

### State-wise Breakdown

On the right, top-performing states are listed along with their regional color, making it easy to associate state-level impact with regional totals.

### CY vs PY Metrics Table

This section gives a detailed comparison of:
- CY and PY Sales
- CY and PY Profit
- Quantity sold in both years
- YoY (Year-over-Year) % changes for each metric

This makes it simple to spot performance jumps or drops at a glance.

## Key Insights

- The East region leads in total sales this year with $156.45K, reflecting a 21% increase over the previous year.
- The South region underperformed with a 31% drop in sales compared to last year.
- West and Central regions showed small declines in YoY sales, but had steady profits.
- Quantity sold has increased overall by 5%, indicating stronger product movement even where revenue growth was flat.

## Use Cases

- Weekly or monthly sales reviews by leadership
- Regional manager performance tracking
- Marketing and inventory planning based on regional demand
- Supporting reports for investor or board presentations

## Data Notes

- The selected year in this version is 2022.
- No data is available for 2021 in the current dataset, which is why previous year metrics show "No Data" if 2021 is selected.
- All figures are represented in thousands (e.g., $102.87K = $102,870).
